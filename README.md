# Recommender System using Two Tower Neural Nets

## About The Project
This project is about building a recommendation system using Two Tower Neural Nets. The Two Tower Neural Nets model is a deep learning model that is widely used in recommendation systems. It consists of two neural networks, a user tower, and an item tower, that learn user and item embeddings, respectively. The embeddings are then combined to generate recommendations for the user.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Book-Crossing Dataset, which is a 4-week crawl dataset from the Book-Crossing community. It contains 2,78,858 users who are anonymized, but with demographic information, providing 1,149,780 ratings (explicit/implicit) about 2,71,379 books.
