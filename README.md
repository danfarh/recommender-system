# Recommender System using Two Tower Neural Nets

## About The Project
This project is about building a recommendation system using Two Tower Neural Nets. The Two Tower Neural Nets model is a deep learning model that is widely used in recommendation systems. It consists of two neural networks, a user tower, and an item tower, that learn user and item embeddings, respectively. The embeddings are then combined to generate recommendations for the user.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the XSum dataset, which is a collection of news articles and their corresponding summaries.
